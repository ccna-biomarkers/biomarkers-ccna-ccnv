CCNA team 9 imaging derivatives
===============================

.. warning:: This documentation corresponds to the ccna-2020 release. This is a work-in-progress, and not all the imaging biomarkers scheduled for release are included.

350+ clinicians and researchers throughout Canada came together to form the `Canadia Consortium on Neurodegeneration in Aging (CCNA) <https://ccna-ccnv.ca/>`_ in 2014, with the goal of accelerating progress in research on age-related neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimerâ€™s disease, Vascular dementia, Frontotemporal dementia, and Lewy body dementia. They have assembled a pan-Canadian cohort on Comprehensive Assessment of Neurodegeneration and Dementia (COMPASS-ND). The current documentation describes an effort of team 9 "discovering new biomarkers" of CCNA, aimed at generating standardized imaging biomarkers for all COMPASS-ND data. These imaging biomarkers are openly shared as part of the CCNA data infrastructure.
